Zinc is a light gray style optimized for data visualization overlays. Give 
OpenStreetMap data a professional basemap skin using the Tangram graphics library 
and Mapzen's versatile Vector Tiles. 
#
Mapzen's Zinc style is comparable to Esri's light gray Canvas style, Mapbox's Light 
style, and CartoDB's Positron by Stamen style. If you like any of those, Mapzen's 
Zinc basemap style is for you. Please use and adapt the open source scene file in  
your own projects!
